  caveats <<~EOS
    The CallLane driver package asks for your admin password once. On first launch
    CallLane asks for microphone access: it reads its own hidden tap device, not your mic.

    CallLane is signed ad-hoc. Clear the quarantine flag before the first launch:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CallLane.app
    or allow the app under System Settings → Privacy & Security after it is blocked.
